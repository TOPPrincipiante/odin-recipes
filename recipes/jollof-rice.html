         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. 
                 <ul>
                    <li>Add 1/2 onion, ginger, 
                crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper,
                 and cayenne pepper. Mix well.</li> 
                 <li>Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 
                    minutes.</li> 
                    <li>Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 
                  minutes.</li>
                  <li>Remove from heat.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- End of Step 1 -->
            </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a 
                fine-mesh sieve. <ul>
                    <li>Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <!-- End of Step 2 -->
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <!-- End of Step 3 -->
            <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run 
                clear, about 30 minutes. 
                <ul>
                <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part 
                should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <!-- End of Step 4 -->
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion 
                until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. 
                <ul>
                <li>Add tomato sauce; cook and 
                stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <!-- End of Step 5-->
                <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and 
                    pepper into the pot.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is 
                    almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li> 
                    <li>Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice 
                    is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    <!-- End of Step 6 -->
                    <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. 
                        <ul>
                        <li>Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes 
                        per side.</li> 
                        <li>Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with
                             chicken.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <!-- End of Step 7 -->
         </ol>
